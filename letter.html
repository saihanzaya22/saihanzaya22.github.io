            <p>Dear Pookie,</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday to the most wonderful person in my life! On this special day, I want to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me and how grateful I am to have you in my life.</p>
            <p>From the very first day we met, you have brought so much joy, love, and much more new feelings into my world. Your smile and your pics lights up my dark days hhi, and your shy little laughter is the sweetest music to my ears. You are my rock, my favorite disney princess, favorite flower kkk. I cherish every moment we spend together, and I am constantly amazed by your kindness, strength, and beauty also by how caring, understanding and clever you are.</p>
            <p>Even though we are miles apart, my heart is always with you. I dream of the day when we can see each other face to face again and create even more silly beautiful little memories. Until then, I hold onto the thought of you and your picture on my lockscreen, which gives me warmth and comfort.</p>
            <p>I hope this birthday is as special and amazing as you are. May it be filled with love, laughter, and everything your heart desires. You deserve nothing but the best, and I promise to do everything in my power to make you happy.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being you and being a part of my life.</p>
